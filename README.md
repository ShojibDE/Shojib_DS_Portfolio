# Shojib_DS_Portfolio
A high level overview about my works and projects
# [Project 1 estimate which employesses are more likely to quit](https://github.com/ShojibDE/Project-1-Human-Rescource)
## Supervised learning model, Classification Problem
* Create a tool for HR team to help them identify the  employeees who  are quitting.
* Used Logistic Regression and Ensemble model(Random Forest),on top to Scikitlearn. 
*  Deep Learning model,trained on the top of Keras API, to observe which model works well.
*  used ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS architecture

# [Project 2 Forecasting the future sales of chain store](https://github.com/ShojibDE/Projects-2-Sales)
## Unsupervised learning
* Build a Machine Learning model to predict their future sales based on past data.
*  build on the top of Facebook Prophet framework.

# [Segmenting the customers into three distinct groups so better marketing largeted add can launch.](https://github.com/ShojibDE/Project-3-Marketing)
## Unsupervised Technique
* separating customers three distinct groups.In order to better targeted marketing campaign can launch
* KMeans Algorithm used.
* Choose cluster by using Elbow-method
* PCA also used reducing dimension
* APPLY AUTOENCODERS (PERFORM DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION USING AUTOENCODERS)
